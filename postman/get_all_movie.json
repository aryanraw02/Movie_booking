                "content": "Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away (Released Date : 12 December 2002 ) is a work of magic that you shouldn’t miss. It is an unforgettable, thrilling and enchanting anime movie. Easily one of the best movies I’ve ever watched and the best movie in Studio Ghibli. Studio Ghibli is from Japan, and there are many movies from it like Howl’s Moving Castle, War Of The Fireflies, Whisper Of The Heart, and My Neighbour Totoro. You will definitely love Spirited Away if you are an anime fan. Even if you hate anime, you need to watch this masterpiece. The genre of Spirited Away is Fantasy, Adventure, and Mystery. The main meaning of the movie is that you should never forget who you are. This movie is for everyone to watch, or anyone who needs a movie to watch. The main character, Chihiro, (Rumi Hiiragi) is a brave, kind, and caring 10 year old girl. Her mother and father take her to an abandoned amusement park. After both her parents are turned into pigs, Chihiro is lost in a spiritual world and she is helped by Haku, (Miyu Irino) who gives her pills that keep her in human form. The animation is amazing with Chihiro’s expressions and emotions. Spirited Away has won awards like Academy Award For Best Animated Features, Critic’s Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Golden Bear Award. All of the music in the movie is really smooth and calm to listen to. You should definitely listen to One Summer’s Day, Always With Me, and A Road To Somewhere. Spirited Away has many lessons to it, like that you should be brave, and the only way to get anywhere in life is to work hard. The characters have different abilities. For example, there is a character called No-Face, and he can gain emotions and physical traits from people. Spirited Away is a wonderful movie and I definitely recommend this movie if you don’t have any movies to watch and if you haven’t watched it yet. I would give Spirited Away 5 stars out of 5! It was catchy, full of suspense, and humorous. Watch the movie, it is truly worth your time, and you will be… Spirited Away. ♥",

It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today.",

Meanwhile Caesar has established a community deep in the woods, founded off the survivors of the battle on the Golden Gate bridge. When a group of men ventures into the woods looking for an old dam in the hope of getting power to their community, it tests trust and loyalty within both camps.",

As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.\n\nI am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.\n\nI agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.\n\nI give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.",

The acting in this film isn't bad, but it definitely won't win any awards for it.\n\nThe story has characters Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test their \"hollow earth\" theory. Tom Hiddleston plays a tracker, Brie Larson plays a photographer, and John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on Skull Island.",

For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties.\n\n\"Captain America 3\" starts off where \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.",

It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today.",

Little by little everything is explained again in such a way that I partially knew it again. And even though \"Pacific Rim\" wasn't high-quality cinema and simply a very expensive monster film with superb looking computer-generated images, the film impressed me at the time. \"Pacific Rim\" was brainless amusement with a high entertainment value. This sequel is simply a duplicate with other main characters in identical Jaegers. But it's so irritating and annoying mostly. I was hoping this time the Kaiju's took control and destroyed planet earth. That way we don't need to be afraid of a possible sequel in the future.",

As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.\n\nI am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.\n\nI agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.\n\nI give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.",
